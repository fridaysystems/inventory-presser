* [Changed] Moves the `settings()` and `meta_prefix()` methods into the new API class but maintains and rewrites their original locations for backwards compatibility.
* [Changed] Adds the flexslider CSS class to the Vehicle Slider widget make initialization JavaScript simpler and like other sliders.

= 11.4.1 =
* [Fixed] Enqueue flexslider styles when the slick-based Slider widget is rendered. We use the same slider button icons in both flexslider and slick, but the slick widget icons only worked when there was also a flexslider on the same page.

= 11.4.0 =
* [Added] Adds support for another EPA Fuel Economy stat, the five year savings compared to the average vehicle. This detail will display in the EPA Fuel Economy widget if the "Include annual consumption, cost & emissions" setting is enabled and the vehicle has a value for the field.

= 11.3.0 =
* [Added] Adds a stylesheet for the EPA Fuel Economy widget.

* [Changed] Doubles the post meta fields for EPA fuel economy data after realizing the data can contain two fuel types for a single vehicle.
* [Changed] Rewrites the EPA Fuel Economy widget to no longer use serialized meta data and to use CSS grid instead of a <table> element. This rewrite also includes support for two fuel types on a single vehicle.
* [Removed] Stops registering a meta field on the location taxonomy to hold serialized phones and hours data.

= 11.2.1 =
* [Fixed] Fixes a bug to account for when connections to carfax.com fail and icons cannot be retrieved. Now falls back to the icons that are bundled with this plugin.
* [Fixed] Fixes a bug that was sending 'auto' into wp_constrain_dimensions() instead of a numeric pixel value of the height of the image.
* [Fixed] Fixes a bug that would cause the Hours widget to only be partially output if there were no sets of hours to display. Now, the widget will vanish entirely.

* [Fixed] No longer duplicates the delete button when copying the table row to create a new additional listings page. You can't delete a page that isn't saved yet, so this button was misleading.
* [Changed] Updates the get_book_value() method in our vehicle class to use the new, dedicated meta fields for book values rather than the serialized prices array.
* [Changed] Changes the single vehicle shortcode to use the vehicle description stored in post meta rather than post_content. This shortcode is used when the active theme does not have a template for a single vehicle page.
* [Changed] Rewrites the Hours and Phone Number widgets to use the nonserialized location meta values.
* [Changed] Creating and editing of hours and phone numbers in the dashboard no longer uses the serialized location meta values.

= 10.12.1 =
* [Fixed] Fixes a bug when injecting stock numbers into Carfax icon CSS class names where characters that are allowed in stock numbers but not in CSS class names were breaking this hack that lets us show more than one Carfax icon inline on the same page.

* [Fixed] Fixes a bug in our Vehicle class where requesting a list of the post meta keys without the ones that contain serialized values returned those very keys that contain serialized values.

= 10.11.1 =
* [Fixed] Fixes a bug where our post meta keys for both vehicles and photos were being registered on the vehicle post type instead of on our post type and on the post type 'attachment'.

= 10.11.0 =

* [Changed] Changes Carfax buttons to use the new action hooks described above instead of relying on templates.

= 10.9.0 =
* [Added] Adds a plugin sidebar to allow users to edit vehicle attributes in the Editor using a WordPress 5.0.0 friendly method rather than old Editor meta boxes.
* [Fixed] Fixes a bug where our Editor block category was only being added when editing posts in the vehicles post type. This was wrong, and the block category should be registered no matter what or the Editor throws JavaScript errors when editing posts of other types.
* [Fixed] Fixes a bug when registering scripts and styles for the Dashboard. An incomplete path prevented these registrations from succeeding.
* [Fixed] Now explicitly deletes a vehicle's attachments when vehicles are deleted

= 10.7.1 =
* [Fixed] Fixes a bug in the "${price} / ${down} Down" price display setting where neither price would show if a vehicle did not have a down payment. Starting now, the price will show by itself even when there is no down payment.

= 10.6.0 =
* [Added] Adds YouTube video ID to the edit screen so that the field can be edited by users in the dashboard.
* [Fixed] Bug fix for Carfax-hosted Carfax buttons. Carfax did not anticipate inline display, and certain combinations of buttons on the same page break all sorts of CSS. Now inserting vehicle stock numbers into Carfax CSS class names to avoid conflicts.

= 10.5.2 =
* [Changed] Changes the flexslider spin up to stretch images that are smaller than the width of the slider.

= 10.5.1 =
* [Fixed] Fixes a bug when renaming the option when some settings have never been assigned a value

= 10.5.0 =
* [Added] Adds a Price Display setting that lets users show MSRP values, down payments, or 'Call For Price' instead of vehicle prices. This feature was built into the _dealer theme, but now lives in core so it's easy for widgets to show appropriate prices.
* [Added] Adds filters `invp_price_display_options` and `invp_price_display` that allow developers to create their own price display options.
* [Added] Adds a method to the vehicle class that identifies the address where the vehicle is located when there is more than one term in the locations taxonomy containing vehicles.
* [Added] Adds a filter `invp_vehicle_location_sentence` so that the output of the new location sentence method in the vehicle class can be filtered.
* [Changed] The location property of the vehicle class is now populated with the location term description (full address) instead of the name (street address line 1).
* [Changed] The settings() method on the Inventory_Presser_Plugin class is now a static method.

= 10.4.0 =
* [Added] The vehicle class now tracks two new Carfax fields for report URL and icon URL. Carfax's latest feed to service providers gives the organization a bit more control over the URLs where reports live and the icon that appears on dealer websites. This plugin still ships with Carfax icons, and they will continue to be used when they apply to the vehicle and the newer fields are not available.
* [Added] The vehicle class now tracks transmission speeds in post meta. The existing transmission taxonomy is unchanged.
* [Added] Adds a meta value containing the photo order integer to vehicle photos that are uploaded directly into the Media Library
* [Changed] The vehicle class' transmission member `$vehicle->transmission` will now include the number of speeds in the transmission instead of simply the name of the term in the transmission taxonomy. What was "Automatic" may now be "6 Speed Automatic" if this new field is used.
* [Removed] Removes a vehicle class member `color_string` that would hold a string like "Blue Exterior / White Interior". This was a feature used in only one theme that we are no longer recommending. This feature was moved to the child themes where it is used. We've decided not to advance the major verison number despite this removal because this plugin is not yet distributed and no current installs are using the member.
* [Fixed] Fixes a bug in the vehicle class' youtube_url() method
* [Fixed] Restores functionality that shows odd-size or mismatched aspect ratio photos at full width in flex slider. This functionality was lost in 10.2.0.

* [Changed] Moves some activation and deactivation hooks into the taxonomies class where their callback methods live

= 10.3.0 =
* [Added] Adds the ability to set the Inventory listing as the home page

= 10.2.1 =

= 10.2.0 =
* [Added] Adds CSS for the Grid widget and shortcode. Previously, the styles that styled this widget lived in the _dealer theme.
* [Changed] Upgrades the version of flexslider embedded in this plugin to the latest version, 2.7.2. This changes the previous and next arrow buttons from their location in the top right of photos to the left and right sides of the frame how most sliders operate.

= 10.1.0 =

* [Changed] Combines the code generating the Inventory Grid Widget and Shortcode so that each supports the same parameters and generates the same output while maintaining backwards compatibility

* [Fixed] Make sure some values we anticipate to be strings are strings before trying to use them to load locations or redirect to a make archive
* [Fixed] Do not load the slick slider JavaScript if another plugin or theme has already loaded it to avoid a conflict and errors

= 9.1.0 =
* [Added] Deletes unused terms in a handful of the custom taxonomies once a week using a wp-cron job. Years of inventory churn created hundreds of empty terms before this feature.

= 9.0.0 =
* [Added] Add a setting to both the Grid and Vehicle Slider widgets to order vehicles with the newest ones first
* [Added] Add editor blocks for most of the vehicle attributes
* [Added] Add a setting to the Options page that allows users to show all taxonomies under the Vehicles menu in the Dashboard
* [Added] Enable print buttons in menus on any Custom Link menu item with a target of "#" and a CSS class of "invp-print-button"
* [Changed] Changes the "Requires at least" version number to 5.0.0 because this version adds editor blocks that do not work on older versions of WordPress

* [Changed] No longer defines a few functions statically to avoid throwing warnings when updating term meta via the REST API.

= 8.3.2 =
* [Fixed] Fixes a bug where a misspelled variable name would prevent an instance of our vehicle class from returning the requested size thumbnails.

= 8.3.1 =
* [Fixed] Fixes a bug where when updating taxonomy terms via the REST API, the old value passed to update_term_meta() would be unnecessarily serialized.

= 8.3.0 =
* [Added] Built-in taxonomies can now accept multiple filters. For example, a URL such as foo.com/inventory/model/accent/model/grand-cherokee/ will list all Hyundai Accents and Jeep Grand Cherokees.
* [Removed] Removed a feature that redirects search results that include only one vehicle to that vehicle's details page. This feature is at odds with allowing multiple taxonomies filters and especially with Vehicle Filters Widget version 4.0.0.

= 8.2.0 =
* [Added] Adds a Google Map widget that points at an address stored in this plugin's location taxonomy of the user's choosing
* [Fixed] Changes to achieve compatibility with PHP 7.2: a few create_function() calls were rewritten to use anonymous functions

= 8.0.0 =
* [Changed] Changed the custom post type definition to always has_archive, despite whether or not the theme has a proper template to show vehicles.

= 7.1.0 =
* [Added] Added a filter `shortcode_atts_inventory_slider` to the [invp-inventory-slider] shortcode so that the attributes can be filtered. Also added the orderby and order parameters of the queries inside this shortcode to the shortcode attributes so they can be filtered.
* [Added] Added a filter `invp_slider_widget_query_args` that wraps the arguments that find vehicles that will populate the widget version of the slider.
* [Fixed] Fix some bugs in the KBB Widget where we were assuming the widget's settings contain values.

= 7.0.0 =
* [Added] Save a unique ID with phone numbers and sets of hours that are created in the dashboard. These IDs allow numbers or hours to be unique identified even if their labels change.
* [Changed] Changed the permalink behavior for the vehicles post type to ignore any prefix by setting `with_front` to false. This means sites can have blogs at site.com/blog and vehicles at site.com/inventory instead of site.com/blog/inventory.
* [Changed] Stop using a deprecated hook `media_buttons_context` and start using `media_buttons` instead.
* [Fixed] Fixes a bug that prevented our location taxonomy from outputting the phone number and hours array in REST API responses
* [Removed] Support for AutoCheck reports has been removed from this plugin and now lives in an add-on called AutoCheck Buttons.
* [Removed] Management of a Friday System's customer index as a meta field in our location taxonomy. In preparation of a public release, this company-specific code has no place in this plugin.

* [Changed] Change the style of phone number and hours inputs in the locations taxonomy terms found at Vehicles > Locations. These controls now more closely match the WordPress dashboard style.

= 6.0.1 =

* [Fixed] Fixes a bug where the wrong text-domain was provided for a translatable string

= 6.0.0 =

* [Added] Help our suite of add-on plugins activate licenses at inventorypresser.com and receive automatic updates by adding a license class
* [Added] Pass the vehicle object into the invp_zero_price_string filter so the zero price string can be easily changed based on vehicle attributes

= 5.0.0 =
* [Added] Created a workaround to save term meta via the REST API, WordPress 4.9.4 seems a bit broken here.
* [Changed] Do not show sold units in inventory listings by default, and add an option to include them.
* [Changed] Use lowercase meta field names all the time, and change the vehicle class to not capitalize the id in car_id.
* [Fixed] Make sure serialized meta values (like vehicle option lists, EPA fuel economy data, and the prices array) are unserialized before saving. Edits via the REST API were resulting in twice-serialized values.
* [Fixed] Fixed a bug in our logic that redirects users who are trying to view deleted vehicles.

= 4.2.0 =
* [Added] Include term IDs for each of our custom taxonomies in the REST API responses for our posts.

* [Added] Add two template tags, `invp_get_the_vin()` and `invp_get_the_price()` to make access easy for themes and other items in the loop.
* [Fixed] Change links to terms in our taxonomies to contain /inventory, so one of our rewrite rules is used to guide the request.

* [Changed] Create the body styles taxonomy before the location taxonomy so they load in that order, purely for appearance and usability

= 3.3.0 =
* [Changed] AutoCheck report fetching is rewritten to use a newer end-point at Friday Systems

= 3.2.0 =
* [Added] When shoppers navigate to vehicles that are no longer on the site, redirect them to an archive page of all vehicles of the same make
* [Added] Make it easy for themes to include Schema.org structured data for vehicles via a new method on our vehicle class
* [Added] Include custom taxonomy names and slugs in searches, so searches for "suv" and "diesel" are now possible
* [Added] A mower vehicle type is now populated in the Type taxonomy
* [Changed] Now prioritizes featured vehicles when filling the slider
* [Changed] Tested up to date to 4.8.1
* [Fixed] A vehicle class member was typoed as drivetrain and changed to drivetype
* [Removed] An unused theme-specific setting that allowed the footer link text to be overriden has been removed from the options page

= 3.1.0 =
* Adds a filter hook to the VIN input box on the edit vehicle screen in the dashboard. This permits our newest add-on plugin, [a VIN decoder](https://inventorypresser.com/products/plugins/vin-decoder/), to place a "Decode VIN" button adjacent to the VIN text box.
* Adds an empty drop down option to the model year selector on the edit vehicle screen in the dashboard. Previously, new vehicle entries would save the current year if the user makes no selection.
* Screenshots are updated

= 3.0.0 =
* Consolidates all settings under the Vehicles custom post type menu submenu Options. This saves the default sort field and order in a different location, so those values will need to be migrated when upgrading.

= 2.3.5 =
* Use save_post_inventory_vehicle instead of save_post and then a check to make sure we are working on our post type
* Bug fix for the parameters passed into the save_post/save_post_{post-type} action handler
* Skip the extra stuff that happens when vehicles are saved if the vehicle was just moved to the trash

= 2.3.4 =
* Bug fix to not modify ORDER BY clauses on term queries for model years and cylinder counts when no order is specified

= 2.3.3 =
* Bug fix in Order By Post Meta widget. A bad string concatenation prevented the output of list items and links.
* Bug fix while editing vehicles in the Dashboard. The last modified date was not being saved with the correct timezone offset.

= 2.3.2 =
* Bug fix when queuing scripts for our shortcodes. Previously, we were using a $post variable before a global $post; call.

= 2.3.1 =
* Include dashicons on the front-end. Previously, this was handled by a widget that we were also using on every site. That widget has been rewritten and this bug was revealed.

= 2.3.0 =
* Delete all inventory feature now ignores post status and deletes any and all
* Delete all inventory method now runs an action hook after the deletions occur, inventory_presser_delete_all_inventory
* Only insert the default terms into our custom taxonomies during plugin activation instead of on every page load when the taxonomies are created

= 2.2.0 =
* New features for boat dealers. We have added a propulsion type taxonomy and vehicle fields for beam, length, and hull material. The edit screen will change to accomodate this data when the vehicle type boat is chosen or loaded.
* Adds a filter to the "Dealer Hours" widget so that our new plugin, Hours Today Shortcode, can add a sentence like "Open until 6:00 pm today" near the table of hours.

= 2.1.0 =
* Now supports child themes
* A taxonomy for body style is added
* Now supports boats and buses
* Vehicle list in the dashboard now has inline thumbnails
* Now supports Cargurus badges, AutoCheck report retrieval, Edmunds.com style IDs and YouTube video IDs
* Delete all data button on options page now deletes all terms in the taxonomies this plugin creates and widget options

= 2.0.0 =
* Stop manipulating imports. All import related code has been moved to another plugin where it belongs. Lots of code has been deleted.

= 1.5.0 =
* Stop pruning the pending attachments folder during every import via the import_end hook.
* Stop copying attachment payloads during imports unless the file date is newer than the payload that was previously imported.
* Stop uniting orphan attachments with their parents during every import via the import_end hook. Use a new hook to find parent post IDs as the attachments are processed.
* A new method set_thumbnails() hooks on import_end to set thumbnails for vehicles with attachments.

= 1.4.2 =
* Obsoleted the postmeta key _inventory_presser_file_name_base now that we live in a world where our photo file name bases are VINs
* Stop relying on post title and guid to decide if a vehicle exists. Always use the VIN.

= 1.4.1 =
* Fixed a bug where function_exists() was not used to always make sure get_current_screen() is defined before using it

= 1.4.0 =
* Location taxonomy added to manage single or multi-lot inventories' addresses, phone numbers and hours
* Update term meta during imports when terms aready exist
* Force term recounts when a post is inserted or updated during an import

= 1.3.0 =
* Add custom fields to searches, so searches for a VIN or the color blue work
* Introduce VIN-based URLs that redirect to proper permalinks so that it's easy to link to vehicles

= 1.2.1 =
* Preserves images when deleting vehicles that no longer appear in import files by dissociating them with their parents. This was a weird bug where a vehicle can come through the import with the same VIN but a different unique post slug. Adding this and deleting the old vehicle will lose the photos until the next import runs because they were in the database but deleted at the end of the import. Dissociating the photos allows the new vehicle post to be united with its photos.
* Bug fixes to allow attachments to live in sub-folders of the uploads folder, or now saving vehicle photos in folders per vehicle instead of polluting the uploads folder.
* Attempt to delete the folder that a pending attachment lives in when it is deleted. This will clean up those per vehicle folders in the pending directory.

= 1.2.0 =
* Now implements custom rewrite rules for filtering our post type. These rules lived in a widget until now.
* Added a widget to allow users to reorder vehicles by post meta keys. This enables sorting by year, make, model, price, odometer, etc. This widget was developed as a separate plugin until being rolled in with this update.
* Added a setting to specify a default sort order and direction for vehicle search result pages
* Added checkboxes to the add/edit vehicle page for adding and removing optional equipment
* Converted the [Delete all Inventory] button on the settings page to use a looping AJAX call that will restart deletions during server timeouts.

= 1.1.0 =
* Added CARFAX support to the vehicle object and added three CARFAX icons to the assets directory

= 1.0.0 =
* Changed the post meta key `piped_options` to `option` with the new intent to no longer be a unique key.
* Changed the place where the options list lives again after realizing a non-unique post meta key would cause more problems than it solved. The vehicle options list now lives in `option_array` as a serialized array.
* John Norton joins me and starts building the first theme to use this plugin

= 0.2.0 =
* Moved all code that modifies imports into its own object and file, `includes/class-modify-imports.php`
* Deeper integration with WXR importers so inventory does not have to be deleted before a new import is run. An option called "When importing a feed, delete units not contained in the new feed" is born. Previously, an option allowed users to delete all inventory before a new feed is run. This is a much more nuanced solution that will not vacate the site of inventory during an import, and also reduce the amount churn on post IDs in the database.
* A post meta key called `_inventory_presser_photo_file_name_base` is introduced to help this plugin mate attachments to their parents after an import. A more conventional WordPress import from a backup would identify post IDs. It is possible to not specify post IDs in a WXR XML file, and let the database assign IDs as items are imported. We love this approach, but it means that the import file cannot provide a parent ID for media attachments. This meta key is used to say "Any attachment that does not have a parent post ID and whose filename starts with this string is a child of this post."

= 0.1.0 =
* Implemented semantic versioning
* An object Inventory_Presser_Vehicle has been defined in includes/class-inventory-presser-vehicle.php to aid theme development
* Custom taxonomies enhanced with `labels` values
* Added filter hook `inventory_presser_post_type` so the post type can be renamed
* Added filter hook `inventory_presser_post_type_args` so the post type can be manipulated before the `register_post_type` call
* Added filter hook `inventory_presser_default_options` to manipulate the default option values
* Added filter hook `inventory_presser_taxonomy_data` to filter the built-in taxonomy data

= 0.5 =
* Created a shortcode [vehicle_field] to make it easy for theme developers to get custom fields out of our custom post type
* Enhanced imports to mate photo attachments to parent posts, establishing a relationship between this plugin and WXR importers, especially `WordPress Importer for CRON` that I (salzano) have also written. Also sets first photo as featured image. This whole routine operates according to the photo naming convention we employ at Friday Systems.
* Options page created to hold data deletion buttons
* `Delete all Vehicles` button implemented on the Options page
* `Delete all Plugin Data & Deactivate` button implemented on the Options page
* Attachment count added near Add Media button text
* This readme file was created

= 0.4 =
* A pile of code from 2012 is reread and rewritten in September and October of 2015
* Custom post type & taxonomies completely defined and Add/Edit post screen designed
* Edit.php is customized for our custom post type to list stock number, color, odometer, price & photo count
